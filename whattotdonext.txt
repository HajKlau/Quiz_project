// how to call this programm

// 1st option: 
//      ./output --json-file <path_to_file>
// 2nd option:
//      ./output --yml-file <path_to_file>
//
// So in sum it should have two options to call compiled program (i think it can be done in cpp), options:
// --yml-file
// --json-file
// after accepting this flag/param/whateveritis program should execute certain part of code depending on which param was chosen (e.g. for --json-file it should read json). Optionally you can add verification if json file was truly provided with --json-file flag (by checking file extension).

load
{
    // open file with ifstream
    // based on provided file type (yml/json)
    // here you can try to unify data structure so for the rest of the program it doesnt matter if it was json or yml :)
    // return object as data_structure with questions and answers and correct answer
}

ask
{
    // here simply display in a nice way question to the audience. For graphical representation you can try to use QT (its gui lib for cpp)
}

check
{
    // verify if answer provided is available and then if its correct; if its unavailable then repeat question; if its correct call add_point
}

add_point
{
    // just add point somewhere where it will persist during program madear
}

at the end of main function just show sum of points (object from add_point)
